# Graph-algorithms

This simulator encompasses a variety of graph theory algorithms, offering users options such as Depth-First Search, finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm, discovering connected components, converting directed graphs to undirected ones, generating graphs with random edges of n nodes, and adding edges with specific weights or nodes.
