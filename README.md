# Graph-algorithms

This simulator encompasses a variety of graph theory algorithms, offering users options such as finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm, Depth-First Search, discovering connected components, converting directed graphs to undirected ones, generating graphs with random edges of n vertices, and adding vertices or edges with specific weights.

The data structure for representing the graph is a list of neighbors.
From each vertex, there is a linear linked list that contains its neighbors
